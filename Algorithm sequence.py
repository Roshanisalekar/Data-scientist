# sequence algorithm :-

# 1> sequence algorithm are followed top to bottom 

# 2> sequence algorithm is line by line executed

# example :

# area of the circle 

pi=3.14
r=float(input("enter a radius :-"))

area=pi*r*r

print(f'Area of the circle is :{area}')

output :-
# enter a radius :-12
# Area of the circle is :452.15999999999997
