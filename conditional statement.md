conditional statement : condition based program (one at a time condition run)

there are three mainly cases

1> if statement : the condition is true then block of executed .

2>  if-else statement : the condition is true then block of executed but condition is false then else     part will be excuted.

3> if-elif-else statement : the condition is true then block of executed when elif condition is true then block of executed  but condition is false then else part will be excuted.


why use conditional statement ?

1> controling  program flow

2> responsive code

3> decision-making
