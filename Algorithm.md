                            *** algorithm ***

1> An algorithm is a set of instructions that are followed in order to complete a task or solve a problem. 

2> Algorithms are used in many fields, including computer science, mathematics, and artificial intelligence (AI).         

3> Examples of algorithms

Recipes: Recipes are a series of steps that are followed to create a dish. 
Getting dressed: Putting on clothes in the right order is an algorithm. 
Making coffee: Following a step-by-step process to make coffee is an algorithm. 

*** type of algorithm *** 

1> sequence algorithm 
2> conditional algorithm
3> loop algorithm 

 ***  How algorithms work ***

1> Algorithms take input data
2> The input data is processed through a series of steps in a specific order
3> The output data is produced

*** What are Flowcharts? ***

1> Flowcharts are the visual representations of an algorithm or a process. 

2> Flowcharts use symbols/shapes like arrows, rectangles, and diamonds to properly explain the sequence of steps involved in the algorithm or process.

3> Flowcharts have their use cases in various fields such as software development, business process modeling, and engineering.
