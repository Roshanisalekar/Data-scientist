            # datatype
    There are two type of datatype 
    1> immutable   2> mutable
1>immutable datatype are following 

1>numeric
2>string
3>tuple

2>mutable datatype are following 

1>list
2>dictionary
3>set


immutable :  immutable datatypes are those datatype value cannot change after they are created.



(1) numeric :

int : 1,100,-2,-100,-oo to +oo (infinity)

float : 1.1,2.2,-2.4,-0.100, -oo to +oo

complex : 3+4j


(2) string : it is collection of homogeneous and hydrogeneous which is surrounding by ' ',"" ,''' '''

example : '123%',"#abc"

(3) tuple : it is collection of numeric value and string value and also homogeneous and hydrogeneous value which is surrounding by () and separated by ,

tuple change the location id 

mutable :  mutable datatypes are those datatype value can be change after they are created.

(1) list : list is collection of homogeneous and hydrogeneous value and surrounding by [] sequare braket
and separeted by ,

example : a=[1,2,3]

(2) dictionary : it is collection of key and value pair  which is separated by :  and pair separeted by ,
and surrounding by {}

key  is always unique 

it is does not indexing 

example :
dict:{ k:v ,k1:v,k2:v}

d={'a':1,'b':2,'c':5} print (d)

(3) set : set is collection of unique element .there are  start and end with {} and separeted by , 

there are not following  indexing
